Feedback: With all of the resources avaliable, this project was not that bad.

Time Took: The time it took was around 4-5 hrs in total.

Resources: For an idea of how quicksort worked, I used zybooks: https://learn.zybooks.com/zybook/MSUCSE331OnsaySpring2020
I also looked at this slide to understand the algorithm a little more: https://slideplayer.com/slide/4773827/
A also implemented some of Proffessor Onsay's algorithms for quicksort, subdivide, insertion sort, and median of three.
I also implemented zybooks algorithms for subdivide, here: https://learn.zybooks.com/zybook/MSUCSE331OnsaySpring2020
